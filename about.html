                            <p>
                        Transformation Project Ministries (TPM) is a Christ-centered, Spirit-led ministry with a clear
                        mandate to transform lives through the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. We exist to raise men
                        and women who are rooted in God’s Word, empowered by the Holy Spirit, and committed to
                        fulfilling their divine purpose.
                        </p>
                            <p>
                        TPM is more than a church—it is a family, a training ground, and a movement. Through sound
                        biblical teaching, fervent prayer, prophetic ministry, and practical discipleship, lives are
                        genuinely transformed and believers are equipped to live fruitful and impactful Christian lives.

                            <h4>Transformed Foundations</h4>
                            <p>
                        At Transformation Project Ministries (TPM), transformation goes beyond the walls of the
                        church. We believe the love of Christ must be lived out in practical ways that touch lives and
                        restore hope.
                        </p>
                            <p>
                        Through Transformed Foundations, our compassion and outreach arm, we actively support
                        orphanages and vulnerable children by providing care, resources, and encouragement. This
                        initiative reflects our deep conviction that every child deserves love, dignity, and the opportunity
                        to thrive.
                        </p>
                            <p>
                        Transformed Foundations is our response to God’s call to care for the fatherless and demonstrate
                        His love through action. Through donations, visits, prayer, and acts of service, we extend the
                        heart of Christ to those in need—showing them that they are seen, valued, and loved.
                        </p>
                            <p>
                        As a church family, we joyfully partner together to make a difference, believing that when lives
                        are touched with love, true transformation begins.
