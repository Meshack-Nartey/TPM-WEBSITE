                    At Transformation Project Ministries (TPM), transformation goes beyond the walls of the
                    church. We believe the love of Christ must be lived out in practical ways that touch lives and
                    restore hope.

                <p>
                    Through <strong>Transformed Foundations</strong>, our compassion and outreach arm, we actively support
                    orphanages and vulnerable children by providing care, resources, and encouragement. This
                    initiative reflects our deep conviction that every child deserves love, dignity, and the opportunity
                    to thrive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Transformed Foundations is our response to God's call to care for the fatherless and demonstrate
                    His love through action. Through donations, visits, prayer, and acts of service, we extend the
                    heart of Christ to those in need—showing them that they are seen, valued, and loved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a church family, we joyfully partner together to make a difference, believing that when lives
                    are touched with love, true transformation begins.
